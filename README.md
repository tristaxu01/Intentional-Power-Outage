# US-Power-Outages
This is a project analysing DSC 80 power outage data in US from January 2000 to July 2016
# Introduction
Between **January 2000 to July 2016**, there were total of 1534 number power outrage that impacted at least 50,000 customers or caused an unplanned firm load loss of atleast 300â€¯MW occured in United State. The largest power outage affected approximately 3.5 million people, and a maximum of 41,788 MW Peak Demand Power was lost during a single outage event. The focus of our website is to investigate the relationship between monthly electricity prices in the residential sector (labeled as "RES.PRICE" in the dataset) and power outages caused by intentional attacks. Specifically, we aim to determine **whether regions with a top 25% residential electricity price are more likely to experience power outages caused by intentional attacks.** 

To do this, our team will analyze data from the "RES.PRICE," "Number of customers affected by the power outage event" (CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED), and "Categories of all the events causing the major power outages" (CAUSE.CATEGORY) columns.
